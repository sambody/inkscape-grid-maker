# UPDATE: This repository is no longer maintained. 

As of July 16th 2014, this Inkscape extension has moved to my **[Inkscape guide tools](https://github.com/sambody/inkscape-guide-tools)**, which bundles it with other guide extensions. In that bundle, Grid Maker has been renamed to Add Grid Guides. [Check out the new version here](https://github.com/sambody/inkscape-guide-tools).
